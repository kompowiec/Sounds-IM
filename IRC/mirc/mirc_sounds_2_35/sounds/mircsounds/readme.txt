delete following files:
Chat_mIRC.mrc

Other important stuff


current download page
http://www.scumperson.eu.org/mircsounds/

if you are getting no sound then check the following

options > sounds (all in here)
and
options > general > lock

mp3's arn't played by mirc
make sure you have the latest version of mirc, mirc uses the same codec system media player does
so if media player can play an mp3, so should mirc be able to (in thoery anyway)

poeple using peace and protection appear to have more problems getting sound working
try the following:
P&P menu -> Sound -> Configure -> Sound Types -> Add Type -> Wave
(thanks to scotty in #haloplayers for that)

to update, follow the intuctions as install

Better trout slap
change your trout slap line to this
Trout Slap!:/sound $chan slap.wav slaps $$1 around a bit with a large trout
it'll be in popups.ini
