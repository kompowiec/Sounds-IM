About
-----

These are simply sound from instant messenger. 

As the name suggests, the sounds are taken from said programs and are 
attempted to be used appropriately.

# Contribute
* Use best quality, if possible
	* If it's WAV, use FLAC due to compression (if the WAV file will be smaller than FLAC, you do not need to convert, of course)
* If your file is a lossy sound format, it's best not to convert it, and if anything, then mp3 / ogg format

Legal Warning

All copyrighted material used belongs to their respected owners. None of

purposes. Don't sue me!
